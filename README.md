# Solutions to "Eloquent Javascript" Excercises

My solutions to the excercises of the book [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/);

I'm not in any way related to the (very good) author of the book or the book itself.
I just decided to spend one hour playing with fundamentals of Javascript.

I find very useful to reinforce the basics of a language from time to time, and this was a good opportunity to do so. Maybe someone will find this examples useful as a reference, or can improve, suggest or blame me for this collection:)

# Try it

These excercises work both in Nodejs or in the Browser.

## Browser

Try including a script in a page or copy/paste the functions within a javascript console.

## Nodejs

You can run the script in a shell typing `node chapter/1/1.js`
